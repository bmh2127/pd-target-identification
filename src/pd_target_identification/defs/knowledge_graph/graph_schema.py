# pd_target_identification/defs/knowledge_graph/graph_schema.py
"""
Core schema definitions for the Parkinson's Disease target discovery knowledge graph.

This module defines the fundamental data structures, entity models, and type
enumerations that form the foundation of the knowledge graph representation.
It provides strongly-typed schemas for genes, variants, publications, pathways,
and the relationships between them, ensuring data consistency and type safety
across the entire knowledge graph implementation.

The schemas are designed to capture multi-omics evidence from GWAS associations,
brain eQTL data, literature analysis, and protein interaction networks, providing
a comprehensive representation of therapeutic target evidence.
