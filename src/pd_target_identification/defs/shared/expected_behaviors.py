# Expected Behaviors for PubMedResource
# Test these behaviors before integrating into the full pipeline

"""
CRITICAL BEHAVIORS FOR PubMedResource:

1. **API Rate Limiting Compliance**
   - MUST respect 3 requests/second without API key (10 with key), 10/second with key
   - MUST include proper delays between requests
   - SHOULD handle rate limiting errors gracefully

2. **Search Query Construction**
   - MUST construct proper E-utilities search queries
   - SHOULD limit searches to recent papers (last 5 years)
   - MUST combine gene symbols with Parkinson's disease terms

3. **Error Handling & Resilience**
   - MUST handle network timeouts gracefully
   - MUST handle malformed API responses
   - SHOULD provide meaningful fallback data when API fails
   - MUST log errors without crashing the pipeline

4. **Data Quality & Validation**
   - MUST return structured data with required fields
   - SHOULD filter out papers without abstracts
   - MUST validate PMIDs are numeric strings
   - SHOULD handle missing/incomplete paper metadata

5. **Performance & Efficiency**
   - SHOULD batch requests when possible
   - MUST avoid duplicate API calls for same gene
   - SHOULD cache results during development
   - MUST limit results to reasonable numbers (20-50 papers/gene)

6. **Integration with Pipeline**
   - MUST accept gene symbols from multi_evidence_integrated
   - MUST return DataFrame-compatible data
   - SHOULD provide progress logging for long searches
   - MUST work with Dagster asset execution context

# Expected behavior checklist for integration
PUBMED_INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST = """
Before integrating PubMedResource into the pipeline, verify:

‚ñ° Basic search returns structured data with required fields
‚ñ° Rate limiting prevents API overuse
‚ñ° Error handling doesn't crash on invalid inputs
‚ñ° Batch processing works for multiple genes
‚ñ° Results are reasonable (not empty, not too many)
‚ñ° Data types are correct (PMIDs as strings, years as integers)
‚ñ° Search queries are properly formatted for E-utilities
‚ñ° Recent papers are prioritized (last 5 years)
‚ñ° Abstracts are non-empty when available
‚ñ° Gene symbols are preserved in results

KNOWN LIMITATIONS TO DOCUMENT:
- PubMed API has usage limits (3 req/sec without key)
- Some papers may not have abstracts available
- Search results depend on exact gene symbol matching
- API may be temporarily unavailable
- Older papers may have incomplete metadata
